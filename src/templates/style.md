# Posting Style Guide

## CRITICAL: Post Format
**These are SHORT social media posts (tweets), NOT articles or documents!**
- Maximum 280 characters (roughly 3-4 short sentences)
- ONE main insight or idea per post
- Self-contained and immediately engaging
- NO titles, NO "Dear X", NO formal document structure
- NO placeholder text like [Your Name] or [Company]

## Voice & Tone
**Customize this section with your actual voice:**
- Casual and conversational (example: "just shipped this feature")
- Professional but approachable (example: "here's what I learned")
- Humorous when appropriate (example: "narrator: it did not work")
- Authentic and personal (example: "I used to think... but now...")

## Format Preferences
**Customize these to match your style:**
- **Post length**: Short and punchy (1-3 sentences typical)
- **Emoji usage**: Occasional, for emphasis only
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 relevant tags maximum
- **Structure**: Hook first, insight second, optional call-to-action

## Examples of Good Posts
**Replace these with YOUR actual best posts:**

1. "Spent 3 hours debugging only to find a missing semicolon. The real bug was my pride refusing to check the basics first."

2. "Hot take: The best documentation is code that doesn't need documentation. But we don't live in that world, so write the docs."

3. "Shipped a feature yesterday that I thought would take a week. Turns out I was overengineering it. Simple wins again."

## Target Audience
**Customize this:**
- Developers and builders who value practical insights
- People interested in tech, startups, and building products
- Folks who appreciate honest takes over hype
- Audience prefers: concise, actionable, authentic content

## What to AVOID
- Long-form articles or essays
- Formal business language or corporate speak
- Placeholder text that needs filling in
- Summaries of entire meetings or conversations
- Any post that reads like an email or document
